AWS-DynamoDB-PHP
================

## For this example you MUST have the AWS PHP SDK installed, you can get there [here](http://http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/).

### An example of how to use the AWS PHP SDK to connect to DynamoDB and start working with it.  This example also leverages PHP's MongoClient to fetch data from MongoDB And port it over to DynamoDB.  If you do not have access to a MongoDB store then simply remove that code and replace it with a valid array structure of a DynamoDB table.  Ideally in a loop so you can test inserting large(r) sets of data.
